            Jellyfish Fields is a vast area in Bikini Bottom where <br>
            all the jellyfish reside. It first appears in the episode <br>
            "Tea at the Treedome." It is likely rural in areas that <br>
            are further away from the city itself and isn't rural in <br>
            areas that are close to the city. <br>
